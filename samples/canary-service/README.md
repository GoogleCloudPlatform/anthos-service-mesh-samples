### Canary Service Deployment 

This directory contains `yaml` files for deploying a `v1` and `v2` of `productcatalogservice`, a service in Online Boutique, a microservice demo app. 

To try out a canary deployment, please follow the steps in this [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/by-example/canary-deployment), which will walk you through:
* Deploying Online Boutique with Anthos Service Mesh,
* Splitting traffic between the `v1` and `v2`, 
* Observe your traffic split in the GCP Console,
* Rollout and Rollback
