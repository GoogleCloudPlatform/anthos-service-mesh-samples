# Sample to illustrate how to customize the OnlineBoutique namespace and the ASM_VERSION sidecar injection, you need to replace:
# ONLINEBOUTIQUE_NAMESPACE in for-namespace/kustomization.yaml
# and ONLINEBOUTIQUE_NAMESPACE and ASM_VERSION in for-asm-channel/kustomization.yaml
# before deploying this file.
# As an example:
# sed -i "s/ONLINEBOUTIQUE_NAMESPACE/onlineboutique/g" for-namespace/kustomization.yaml
# sed -i "s/ONLINEBOUTIQUE_NAMESPACE/onlineboutique/g;s/ASM_VERSION/asm-managed-rapid/g" for-asm-channel/kustomization.yaml
