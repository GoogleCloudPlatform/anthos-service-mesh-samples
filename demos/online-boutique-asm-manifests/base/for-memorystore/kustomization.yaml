# Sample to illustrate how to customize the OnlineBoutique's cartservice to use Memorystore (redis) instead of in-cluster redis container, you need to replace:
# REDIS_IP and REDIS_PORT in this current file before deploying this file.
# As an example:
# sed -i "s/REDIS_IP/0.0.0.0/g;s/REDIS_PORT/6379/g" kustomization.yaml
