# Sample to illustrate how to customize the OnlineBoutique's VirtualService with a specific host name rather than '*', you need to replace:
# HOST_NAME in this current file before including this file in another kustomization.yaml file.
# As an example:
# sed -i "s/HOST_NAME/your-host-name/g" kustomization.yaml
