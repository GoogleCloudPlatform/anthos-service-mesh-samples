# Canary Testing 

## Introduction 
Canary Testing is integral with testing when completing upgrades on your cluster.
This directory covers 2 main cases when completing canary upgrades:

* In `canary-service`, we will learn how to Traffic Split to perform a Canary deployment on [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).
* In `canary-cp`, we will learn how to safely complete a Control Plane Canary upgrade with ASM 

In this sample, `productcatalogservice-v2` introduces a 3-second
[latency](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/tree/main/src/productcatalogservice#latency-injection) into all server requests. Weâ€™ll show how to use Cloud Operations and ASM together to
view the latency difference between the existing `productcatalog` deployment and the slower v2 deployment.

## Prerequisites 
Ensure that you have the prerequisites for running ASM on your GCP Project

## Setup


## Deploy the sample app
```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/release/istio-manifests.yaml
kubectl delete serviceentry allow-egress-google-metadata
kubectl delete serviceentry allow-egress-googleapis
kubectl patch deployments/productcatalogservice -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"version":"v1"}}}}}'
```
